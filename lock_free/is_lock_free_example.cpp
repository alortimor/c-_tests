/*
std::atomic_flag does not provide load or store operations.

is_lock_free() determines whether operations on a given type are done directly with atomic
instructions (true) or by using a lock internal to compiler & library (false).


*/

/*

3 categories of operations operations divided into 3 categories:

1. Store operations             - can have memory_order_relaxed, memory_order_release or memory_order_seq_cst ordering
2. Load operations              - can have memory_order_relaxed, memory_order_consume, memory_order_acquire, 
                                  or memory_order_seq_cst ordering
3. Read-modify-write operations - can have memory_order_relaxed, memory_order_consume, memory_order_acquire, 
                                  memory_order_release , memory_order_acq_rel, or memory_order_seq_cst ordering
*/


// default ordering for all operations is memory_order_seq_cst

/* clear() and test_and_set() can have memory ordering  specified

clear() is a store operation, so cannot have memory_order_acquire or memory_order_acq_rel

test_and_set() is a read-modify-write operation, so any any memory ordering can be specified

Common to all atomic types is that you cannot copy-construct atomic object from another atomic, and
you canâ€™t assign one to another!!!
